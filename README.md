## RTSLabsQuestions

This python scrpit contains the solutions to the two coding questions posed to me after my first interview. 


For the third question, I would want to add static typing to python. Part of why I enjoy python is the relaxed syntax and while adding declared types would reduce the readability slightly, 
the speedup benefits would more than compensate. Part of the issue with python is that the interpreter takes so long determining if two objects have compatable operations. With static typing,
this could be done ahead of time and thus make execution time much lower. I could also just use C++, which has all of these features, but the python looping and list comprehension syntax is so freeform.
